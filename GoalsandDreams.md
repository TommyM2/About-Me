# Goals and Dreams 

I have plenty of goals I want to accomplish in life. I'v been through so much in sports it's kind of funny how I'm even here right now. I wasn't really good at football at the start. So many things happened to me during my journey that if I was to say it all you won't even believe me, but god has alwasy been by my side. I alwasy wanted to play conerback. Sadly I didn't start playing corner until junior season, but it didn't go the way I wanted it to. Next thing you know my senoir season was cancelled. I had no film, no stars, unranked, and zero offers. I was unknown. At that point any normal person would've just gave up, but me nope. I kept pushing and praying and now im here all thanks to God. All I'm trying to say is that you should never lose faith and believe in yourself. When you set your mind something, you got to believe that no matter what anybody say or whatever happends I'm not going to quit and soon or later you would accomplish your goal. Just a little life lesson from me. Whenever I start some I finish. I hate starting something and not finishing it because Im going to end up regreting it in the future. Have you ever heard, "Live life with no regrets." Its for that exact reason.
