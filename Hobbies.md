# Hobbies

As I said before , I like playing sports, but I also like to watch anime and play video games on my free time.

I feel like anime is better cartoons plus some animes teach life lessons in it such as never giving up, know your friends and enemies, and so on. My favorite anime of all time is naruto and it is the best anime to ever be created. The first episode of naruto would just make you want to cry. You got to watch it.
